# GeolocationProjectMod4
<p>This project was quite a bit more involved
I enjoyed actually interacting with an API and figuring out how to get it to display what I wanted.
I learned quite a bit more about using github and then integrating that with vercel was a bit of a challenge.
Getting the code to work on vercel was also a challenge but the errors were actually pretty good at helping me to figure out what was going on.
